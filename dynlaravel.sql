Smart door locks offer a wide range of benefits that have made them a popular addition to smart homes across the world.\r\n\r\nOf course, many people are still not 100% convinced on whether investing in a smart door lock is right for them. But it’s worth understanding their key benefits to work out if introducing one could be beneficial to you and your family.\r\n\r\n1. Smart but simple\r\nAs we’ve already highlighted, adding a smart lock to your home is a great way to make your front door security just that little bit easier and convenient. And although they’re generally referred to as ‘smart’ locks, they’ve been designed to make securing your home much simpler.\r\n\r\nThey allow homeowners to easily grant entry, safely and securely, to anyone who needs to get into their home whilst they’re out and about, which is much easier than giving them a spare key and collecting it when they’re back. This simplicity is revolutionary and can save you time and provide the ultimate flexibility in how you secure your home.\r\n\r\n2. Tailored to you\r\nFrom a key card to a key fob and, of course, your smartphone - a smart door lock allows you to choose the best way of opening your door and configure your locking system to suit you.\r\n\r\nFor example, for children who don’t yet own a smartphone, they can have a key fob on a keyring to securely get into the home after school. And if they lose it? Well, this can easily be removed from your system to ensure the ultimate protection if it was to get into the wrong hands.\r\n\r\nHaving the ability to opt for the best entry accessory is a great advantage that other traditional door locking systems could never provide.\r\n\r\n3. Stylish designs\r\nA door lock isn’t the most stylish accessory in your home, but smart locks have introduced a modern alternative where style is at the forefront of their design.\r\n\r\nWith an array of options on the market today, you can opt for a smart door lock that suits your home’s aesthetic - whether that be modern, traditional or colourful.\r\n\r\nFrom a contemporary white shade for a monochromatic home, to a brass finish for classic properties, there’s a finish available to achieve your desired look.\r\n\r\nThere’s also an array of options to suit different door types, whether that be UPVC, composite or wooden designs, so there will be a perfect product to best suit your door.\r\n\r\n4. No slack on security\r\nAnd, most importantly, opting for high quality smart locks, particular those from trusted brands such as Yale, means that their door locks will offer a high level of security matched to that of traditional door locks.\r\n\r\nOne particular way in which smart locks can even heighten your security is that it removes the need for spare keys. These can often go missing, be kept accidently by previous homeowners, or even get stolen, meaning they could be left in the wrong hands. As smart locks don’t have physical keys, this removes this worry immediately. You can grant and revoke keys with just the touch of a button, offering complete control over who has access to your home.\r\n\r\nWhen considering purchasing a smart lock, it’s important to recognise the brand in which you are purchasing from, as this can make a huge difference to the security of your door. Opting for a trusted brand, such as Yale, means you have the experience needed for a secure smart locking mechanism, so you can have peace of mind that your door is protected by the experts.', '1680329577.png', '', NULL, NULL, 'February 03, 2022', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2021-08-07 07:48:04', '2023-04-01 00:42:57'),

After Jai Singh came to power, there was moment of disquiet when he supported Aurangzeb’s son Azam Shah’s bid to the throne. Azam Shah lost the battle of succession to his brother Bahadur Shah, who demanded Jai Singh’s removal and the installation of Vijay Singh to the throne of Jaipur. Jai Singh, not one to take setbacks lying down, formed a formidable front against the Mughals by aligning himself with other Rajput states and reinstated himself.\r\n\r\nAfter the dust had settled, peace reigned and the kingdom prospered and its borders expanded. Jai Singh built the city around the Amber fort to serve as his capital, and the city was named Jaipur, after himself. Much of the credit for Jaipur goes to Vidhyadhar Bhattacharya, the chief architect from Bengal who, with Jai Singh’s approval, founded the city on strong scientific principles, laid out according to the Shilpa Shastra, the ancient architectural manual. It remains one of India’s best planned cities.However, expansion meant that the limited sources of water proved inadequate for the city.\r\n\r\nAfter Jai Singh’s death in 1744, his sons squabbled for power and without a monarch, the kingdom became open to invasion and neighboring Rajput states and the Marathas usurped large areas of kingdom. The core, however, remained part of the kingdom, which lasted during British times. As with the Mughals, Jaipur maintained good relations with the British and during the war of independence in 1857 remained loyal to the Raj. Yet, the British gradually began to undermine the independence of the state and exercised greater control over the administration.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Maharaja Ram Singh painted the entire city pink, traditionally a colour associated with hospitality, to welcome the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) to the city.
